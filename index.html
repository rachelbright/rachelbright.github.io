<h3 style="text-align:center"> About Us</h3>
<p style="text-align:left"> We are a camp in <abbr title="Buena Vista">BV</abbr>, Colorado that is open for
 week-long sessions throughout the summer. We have been here 
 since the 1920s as a place for kids to come. We are available
 for groups of all sizes to come and stay with us. Each year, 
 <em>thousands</em> of kids get to experience camp here. </p>
 <h3 style="text-align:center"> Volunteer </h3>
 <p style="text-align:left"> If you are interested in volunteering with us at Frontier
 Ranch and are of college age, please fill out
 <A href="https://apps.younglife.org/CampRes/App_Pages/publicsiteroot/recommendation"> this application. </A>
 We have three sessions throughout the summer and would love for
 you to come serve with us for one. Come serve kids and have the 
 <b>best month of your life!</b> </p>
 <h3 style="text-align:center"> Schedule </h3>
 <p style="text-align:left"> This is our schedule for the summer of 2018.
 Our hope is that at least one of these sessions will be 
 an opportune time for you to come spend some time at 
 Frontier Ranch. Sessions are broken up into weeks,
 each of which will bring a new group of campers. </p>
